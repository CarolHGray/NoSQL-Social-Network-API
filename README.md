## Description:
This is a set of API for a social network that uses a MongoDB database so that the website can handle large amounts of unstructured data and Express.js for routing. This app currently only has an example of user and thoughts to demonstrate how the database works and can be further populated using MongoDB Compass or HTTpi applications. 


## Acceptance Criteria:

- When you enter the command to invoke the application then the server is started and the Mongoose models are synced to the MongoDB database.  
- Testing API GET routes in HTTpi for users and thoughts return the data for each of these routes in a formatted JSON
- Testing API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in HTTpi are able to successfully create, update, and delete users and thoughts
